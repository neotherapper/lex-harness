# lex-harness v0.1 — Execution Status

> **Single source of truth for plan execution progress.** Update this file after every task completion. Read it before starting a new session.

**Last updated:** 2026-04-08
**Current wave:** Scripts layer ✅ COMPLETE
**Next task:** T11 — `skills/legal-strategy/SKILL.md` (original plan) or knowledge base content porting (Plan B)

---

## Plan source

The plan lives in this repo at `docs/superpowers/plans/`:

- `2026-04-07-lex-harness-v0.1.md` — part 1: T0 read-only prep + T1 init + T2 plugin.json + T3 docs + T4 law pack contract
- `2026-04-07-lex-harness-v0.1-part2.md` — T5–T15 (Greek pack content + skill body + reference files)
- `2026-04-07-lex-harness-v0.1-part3.md` — T16–T27 (3 more skills + 3 commands + templates + git hook)
- `2026-04-07-lex-harness-v0.1-part4.md` — T28–T37 (modules + scripts + tests + CI + release)

The design spec lives at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-07-lex-harness-plugin-design.md`.
The validated Greek corpus map lives at `docs/research/LEGAL_CORPUS_MAP.md` (referenced from T5+).

> **Note:** the plan files were originally written in the yestay project (`~/Developer/projects/yestay/docs/superpowers/`) and then copied here. Any references inside the plan to `~/Developer/projects/yestay/...` are HISTORICAL — when the plan instructs you to read a file, the file IS the one in this `lex-harness` repo. If a plan task says "read `~/Developer/projects/yestay/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-07-lex-harness-plugin-design.md`", that's the same file as `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-07-lex-harness-plugin-design.md` in this repo.

## Workflow rules

**All future work uses GitHub Flow:**

1. Branch off `main`: `git checkout -b <task-id>/<short-desc>` (e.g., `t5/greek-pack-manifest`)
2. Implement the task per the plan
3. Commit with DCO sign-off + Co-Authored-By trailer:
   - `git commit -s -m "$(cat <<'EOF' ... Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com> ... EOF )"`
4. Push: `git push -u origin <branch-name>`
5. Open PR: `gh pr create --title "T5: Greek pack manifest" --body "..."`
6. Self-review the PR
7. Merge via squash (recommended) or merge commit
8. Delete the branch
9. Update this EXECUTION_STATUS.md with the merged commit SHA

**One PR per task** keeps history clean and reviewable. Multiple related tasks in one wave (e.g., T8 + T9 = 22 articles) MAY be combined into one PR if they're tightly coupled.

**Branch naming convention:**
- `t<N>/<short-description>` for plan tasks (e.g., `t5/greek-pack-manifest`)
- `chore/<description>` for housekeeping (e.g., `chore/import-specs-and-plans`)
- `fix/<description>` for bug fixes
- `docs/<description>` for doc-only changes

## Git identity

- gh active account: `neotherapper`
- git user.name: `Georgios Pilitsoglou`
- git user.email: `george.pilitsoglou@gmail.com`
- Repo remote: `https://github.com/neotherapper/lex-harness.git` (HTTPS, uses gh CLI stored credentials)

**Critical:** Do NOT push using SSH. The local SSH key is associated with the `GeorgiosPilitsoglou` GitHub account, NOT `neotherapper`. The remote MUST stay on HTTPS so gh CLI's stored auth is used.

To verify before any push:
```bash
gh auth status 2>&1 | grep -A1 "Active account: true"
# Expected: github.com → neotherapper
```

If the active account is anything other than `neotherapper`, run:
```bash
gh auth switch --user neotherapper
```

## Optional MCP tools used during execution

None of these are required by the plugin itself (PR-11), but they speed up execution:

- **chrome-devtools** — for fetching Greek law text from kodiko.gr / lawspot.gr / search.et.gr / areiospagos.gr
- **WebFetch** — fallback when Chrome MCP is unavailable (slower but always works)
